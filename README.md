# Code Quiz:

# Description:
My task was to create a quiz that would rotate through questions.  First, I assigned a start button.  This button startd and loadd the questions and answers from my array, while hiding other sections of the page.  Once the start button is activated, a timer also starts counting down.  I assigned the time at 60 seconds.  Once an answer is selected, a box appears indicating whether the answer is correct or incorrect. If the answer is incorrect, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer. If an answer is selected correctly, the user is given 1 point.  When the time runs out or the array reaches the end of the questions (whichever comes first), the end function is activated.  This takes down the questions, stops the timer, holds it at 0 seconds, and then opens new boxes.  One box tells the user what their score was while the other offers the user the opportuntiy enter their initials to record their highscore.  Once entered, their initals and score will be set to the screen.  At that time, the quiz is over, but the user can click a button to start over.
